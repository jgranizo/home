                <p>I am an aspiring Data Analyst who loves answering questions with facts! I enjoy fitness and health and would like to someday help people with these two things so they can live a better and healthier life. By being able to create new or existing habits I think this is possible and with the ability to work with data I will accomplish this life goal!
